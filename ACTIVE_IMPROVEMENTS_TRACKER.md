## 🚨 Critical Issues Identified

### Security Vulnerabilities (High Priority)
1. **Deprecated Dependencies with Security Issues:**
   - `chokidar@2.1.8` (no security updates since 2019) → Upgrade to v3
   - `rimraf@2.6.3` → Upgrade to v5+ 
   - `glob@7.x` → Upgrade to v9+
   - `tar@2.2.2` (critical security issues) → Upgrade to latest

2. **Code Security Issues:**
   - TODO item in `src/vs/server/node/serverConnectionToken.ts:20` - Optional type removal needed
   - TODO item in `src/vs/platform/log/common/log.ts:646` - Logger registration cleanup

### Code Quality Issues (Medium Priority)
3. **TypeScript Configuration:**
   - Strict mode not fully enabled
   - Missing null safety checks
   - Inconsistent type definitions

4. **Performance Issues:**
   - Large bundle sizes
   - Memory leaks in event listeners
   - No lazy loading for extensions
